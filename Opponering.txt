General:
1. Why no theory part?
2. From "The efficiency of any until the end should probably lie under theory."
3. Good rapport!
4. Interesting to read!
5. Did you choose the material or is this ongoing research?
6. Good pictures!

Introduction:
1. "Besides, thermo..." should be "Also, thermo..."
2. What is Z, T? Why ttwo T? what units should everything be in?
3. Why is the studies on thin film Ca3Co4O9 Limited?

Experimental details:
1. Does CCO1,2,3, mean anything? or just names? Elemental ratio, do you mean 
different isotopes or different chemical composition? thus not Ca3Co4O9.
2. "The total pressure of gases was maintained to 2m (Torr)" should be 2mTorr.
3. What do you mean by oxygen environment? Ca: 100% oxygen?

Results and discussion:
1. Figure 2. What would the expected phase have looked like?
2. What do you mean by "the as-deposited films"
3. Figure 3. What do you want to explain with this figure? 
Explain more as you have done with the other figures.
4. When did you actually confirm that you got the wanted film?

Conclusion:
1. where is the first part shown?
2. When did you discuss co-sputtering and how did you show that this gave good control?
3. Where did you sho that whis was faster? Compared to what?

Discussion parts:
1. Why did you choose to not explain EDS, pole figure analyses etc?
2. When did you actually confirm that you got the wanted film? 
What were you looking for? Would you know if you found it?
